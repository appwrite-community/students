In this repo, we’ve put together everything you need to get started: from documentation and tutorials to making your first open-source contribution, plus how the Appwrite community can support you along the way. 

## Docs

## Your guide to open source

Appwrite is an open-source backend-as-a-service platform, which means we benefit from the talent and ingenuity of the entire OSS community. In fact, we wouldn’t be where we are today without our amazing contributors, and we make sure to show our appreciation [through social media](https://appwrite.io/blog/post/how-to-attract-users-to-open-source-project) and [swags](https://appwrite.store/). OSS is where (in our humble opinion) innovation happens, so we’re eager to expand and give back to the community.

We’d love for you to contribute to Appwrite, too! If this is your first time contributing to an OSS project, not to worry — we’re got guides to get you started. You can take a look at the open issues, select one and get working on it.
